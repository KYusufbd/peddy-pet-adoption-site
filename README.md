## ES6 features used in this project:
This project utilizes several key features of JavaScript ES6, including:
1. Arrow Functions: A widely used ES6 feature that provides a concise syntax for writing functions.
2. Template Literals: These offer a simple way to create strings with embedded expressions using placeholders.
3. Default Parameters: ES6 allows you to set default values for function parameters, simplifying function calls and reducing the need for explicit checks for missing arguments.
4. Promises: Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations more efficiently in ES6.
5. Let and Const Declarations: ES6 introduces block-scoped variables with let, reducing hoisting issues. The const keyword defines constants, preventing reassignment and improving code reliability and maintainability.
